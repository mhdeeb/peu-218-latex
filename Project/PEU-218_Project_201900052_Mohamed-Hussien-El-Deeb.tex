\section{Introduction}

Stokes' curl theorem, also known as the Kelvin-Stokes theorem after \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kelvin}{Lord Kelvin} and
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_George_Stokes,_1st_Baronet}{George Stokes}, is a theorem in vector calculus on \({\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}\). Given
a vector field, the theorem relates the integral of the curl of the vector field over some
surface, to the line integral of the vector field around the boundary of the surface. This theorem can be
stated as: The line integral of a vector field over a loop is equal to the surface
integral of its curl over the enclosed surface. This unlocks integration shortcuts that greatly simplifies other theorems and speeds up computations.
This project is an attempt to build a simple vector calculus framework to verify and visualize
Stokes' curl theorem using basic numerical methods and the web graphics library \href{https://threejs.org/}{three.js}.

\section{Stokes' Curl Theorem}
\subsection{Definition}

Stokes' theorem states that the line integral of a vector field \(\mathbf{F}\) around a closed curve \(C\) is equal to the surface integral of the curl of \(\mathbf{F}\) over any surface \(S\) bounded by \(C\). Mathematically, the theorem can be stated as:

\[
\oint_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_{S} (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{S}
\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\mathbf{F}\) is a differentiable vector field.
    \item \(C\) is a piecewise-smooth, positively oriented simple closed curve in space.
    \item \(S\) is a piecewise-smooth, positively oriented surface in space bounded by \(C\).
    \item \(d\mathbf{r}\) is the differential arc vector along \(C\).
    \item \(d\mathbf{S}\) is the differential area vector of \(S\).
\end{itemize}
